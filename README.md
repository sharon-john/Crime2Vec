# Word2Vec
A Skip-gram Word2Vec model in Gensim 

This is an excerpt from the code I wrote at my 2017 summer internship at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI).

The Word2Vec model (Mikolov et al) typically used for natural language processing tasks has here been applied to a traditional 
classification problem to enable a more rich spatio-temporal analysis of this crime data. The data set used here is the San Francisco
data set available on Kaggle and is used as a proof-of-concept for the model itself to be applied to a different data set. The Gensim 
library was used to implement the model.
